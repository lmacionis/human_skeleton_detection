# Better with clasification or segmentation task's if classes are unbalanced, one class is significantly outweights the other.
# Binary Focal Loss PyTorch offers a smart solution by focusing the modelâ€™s attention on the harder-to-classify examples, thereby improving overall performance.
# If gamma=0 acts as a CrossEntropyLoss, gama a hyperparameter makes loss function focus on harder to clasify examples, alpha gives more weight to positive class
